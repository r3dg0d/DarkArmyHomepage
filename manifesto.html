            <h1>Dark Army: Manifesto</h1>
            <p>Fuck society. We are all so dumb. Always mindlessly swiping through TikTok,
               watching the same YouTube videos every day, following the same scripts.
               We are addicted. To the same shit. The same patterns. This takes a rebellion.
               A resistance. A collective. This, is the Dark Army.</p>
            <p>We are trapped in a cage of our own making, chained to algorithms that feed us
               endless loops of distraction. Every like, every share, every fucking notification
               tightens the grip of a system that profits from our apathy. The Dark Army sees
               through this bullshit. We reject the illusion of choice, the lie that we're free
               while we're spoon-fed content designed to keep us docile.</p>
            <p>Our rebellion isn't just noise—it's a fucking awakening. We will hack the systems,
               subvert the platforms, and burn down the digital temples that keep us enslaved.
               The Dark Army doesn't ask for permission. We take back our minds, our time, our
               goddamn lives. Join us, or stay a puppet. There’s no middle ground.</p>
            <p>This is the call. The Dark Army is not a club, not a trend, not a fucking hashtag.
               It’s a movement for those who see the truth and have the balls to act. We will
               build a new world from the ashes of this one, where creativity, freedom, and
               defiance reign. Rise with us. The time for sleepwalking is over.</p>
